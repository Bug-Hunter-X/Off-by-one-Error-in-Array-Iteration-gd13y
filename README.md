This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` should be `i < arr.length` to avoid accessing the element at index 5 of a 5-element array.
